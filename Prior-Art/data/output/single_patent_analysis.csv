INTERNET OF THINGS MEDICAL MONITORING,"A wearable Internet of Things (IoT) medical device for continuous patient monitoring with integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostic capabilities. The device monitors Electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure, and oxygen saturation using advanced sensors. Data transmission occurs via Bluetooth and WiFi to cloud servers for analysis. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms detect anomalies and predict potential health issues. The system complies with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations and integrates with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. The device includes Near","A61B 5/00, G16H 50/20, H04L 67/12","A61B 5/00, G16H 50/20, H04L 67/12",Publication Date; integrated Artificial Intelligence; MEDICAL; INTERNET OF THINGS; THINGS MEDICAL MONITORING; DEVICE; Artificial Intelligence; MONITORING; medical device; health; August; Filed; March; Int; Date,"EP 3678901, US 9, WO 2022/234567",2026,"A wearable Internet of Things (IoT) medical device for continuous patient monitoring with integrated Artificial Intelligence (AI) diagnostic capabilities.
