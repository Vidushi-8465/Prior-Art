SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR NATURAL LANGUAGE,"A novel Natural Language Processing (NLP) system utilizing deep learning techniques for semantic analysis of textual data. The system comprises a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for enhanced context understanding. The invention includes an Application Programming Interface (API) for integration with existing software platforms. The system achieves 95% accuracy in sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. Applications include automated customer service, chatbot development, and document classification using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.","G06F 17/27, G06F 40/30, G06N 3/08","G06F 17/27, G06F 40/30, G06N 3/08",LEARNING; DEEP LEARNING; SYSTEM; NLP (Natural Language Processing); NATURAL LANGUAGE; METHOD; Natural Language Processing; Language Processing; PROCESSING; METHOD FOR NATURAL; Neural Network; LANGUAGE; analysis; Machine Learning; Convolutional Neural Network,"EP 3456789, US 8, US 9, WO 2020/123456",2026
