    "original_text": "One-Line Problem Statement Design and develop a technology-enabled safety, monitoring, and assistance system to protect sanitation workers of Solapur Municipal Corporation (SMC) from hazardous working conditions, reduce manual exposure to risks, and enhance dignity, safety, and operational efficiency. Context Sanitation workers of Solapur Municipal Corporation perform critical public health and hygiene functions under extremely challenging and hazardous conditions. Their daily responsibilities often involve exposure to extreme weather, entry into confined spaces such as manholes and sewer lines, handling blocked pipelines, and performing high-risk manual operations. These working conditions expose sanitation workers to severe health risks, including toxic gases, infections, structural failures, and accidental flooding. Despite their essential role, many sanitation operations continue to rely on manual processes with limited safety mechanisms or technology support. To promote worker dignity, life safety, and operational efficiency, SMC seeks innovative, practical, and scalable technology-driven solutions that can significantly reduce occupational risks and prevent loss of life or injury. \n\nProblem Description Solapur Municipal Corporation requires a comprehensive safety and support system to address the following challenges: 1. High Risk Due to Manual Exposure \u2022 Direct human entry into manholes and sewer lines. \u2022 Limited availability of mechanized or remote inspection tools. \u2022 Dependence on manual cleaning and maintenance operations. 2. Health and Life Safety Hazards \u2022 Exposure to toxic and explosive gases. \u2022 Risk of suffocation, infections, and long-term health issues. \u2022 Possibility of structural collapse or sudden flooding. 3. Lack of Real-Time Monitoring and Emergency Response \u2022 Absence of real-time gas detection and environmental monitoring. \u2022 No immediate alert mechanisms during emergencies. \u2022 Limited visibility for supervisors during field operations.",
