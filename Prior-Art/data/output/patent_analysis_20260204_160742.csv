COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM FOR AUTONOMOUS,An advanced Computer Vision (CV) system for autonomous vehicle navigation using deep neural networks. The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for real-time object detection and classification. Integration with Global Positioning System (GPS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors provides robust environmental perception. The invention includes Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) acceleration for processing High-Definition (HD) video streams at 60 frames per second. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms enable adaptive behavior in varying weather conditions. The system achieves 99.2% accuracy in pedestrian detection and obstacle avoidance using Artificial Intelligence (AI).,"B60W 30/095, G06K 9/00, G06N 3/04","B60W 30/095, G06K 9/00, G06N 3/04",SYSTEM; COMPUTER VISION; detection; Unit; Processing; Processing Unit; AUTONOMOUS; VISION; neural; COMPUTER VISION SYSTEM; COMPUTER; systems; Patent Documents; VEHICLE; neural networks; network; Rectified Linear Unit; camera; NAVIGATION; deep,"EP 3567890, US 9, WO 2023/098765",2026,An advanced Computer Vision (CV) system for autonomous vehicle navigation using deep neural networks.
